# roleOOC

roleOOC is an initiative to create a platform to be used in-game during LARPs. The first field test will be during 
a post-apocalyptic LARP [Blodsband reloaded](http://bbreloaded.se/ooc) played out in Sweden.

Note! This system is meant to be used as a game within a game. Passwords are not stored in a insecure way. This is by design. 

## Instructions for the terminal
* Tab to show all available commands
** Writing two spaces has the same effect and will show all available commands
* Arrow up and down to go through the command history
* Arrow left and right to move the blinking marker
* Tab after writing one or more letters to auto-complete it into a command (if it finds a match)
** Writing two spaces has the same effect and will auto-complete (useful for devices without a tab button)
* -help used after a command will show instructions on how to use it (Example: enterroom -help)
